## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
One challenge I encountered in creating this submission was familiarizing myself with JavaScript’s syntax and built-in methods. I come from a Python background where code is visually neater because there are fewer syntactical rules to keep track of. Often I would forget to enclose a function or statements with {}, wondering why my code was not working properly. Although optional, I also forgot to add ; at the end of my lines of code. When I was trying to add the random pattern feature that would pick a random button as the next sequence, I expected JavaScript to have a built-in function that returns an integer within a range, but it didn’t so I referred to the official Javascript documentation where it showed me exactly how to code it. Another challenge I encountered when building this feature was implementing a for loop to assign all 8 sequences randomly. After searching the correct syntax to create a for loop, I learned that in JavaScript, there are 3 expressions you must declare: an initial expression, a condition and an incremental expression. While these situations initially proved to be a challenge, I used W3schools and Stack Overflow to familiarize myself with the proper syntax and rules of JavaScript. As a result, I successfully implemented the features I wanted to while also building upon my previous knowledge of JavaScript.
